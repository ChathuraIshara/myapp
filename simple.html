        Writing functions avoids rewriting the same code over and over.
Suppose you have a section of code in your program that calculates
area of a triangle. If later in the program you want to calculate the
area of a different triangle, you won’t like it if you are required to
write the same instructions all over again. Instead, you would prefer
to jump to a ‘section of code’ that calculates area and then jump
back to the place from where you left off. This section of code is
nothing but a function.
